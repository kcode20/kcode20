Hi üëãüèæ , I'm Khristian Adesina ‚Äî a frontend engineer who believes the best technology is deeply human. I build software that does more than function ‚Äî it connects, empowers, and inspires.

At Anheuser-Busch, I am currently working to bring a ‚Äúworld with more cheers‚Äù by developing reusable, high-quality components that scale joy and brand identity. At Meetup, I designed tools that helped people find belonging, matching individuals with communities and driving real-world connection through thoughtful digital experiences.

I strive for excellence in every line of code and every user journey. My approach blends empathy, craft, collaborating with cross-functional teams, anticipating edge cases, and designing for clarity, accessibility, and meaning. From scalable architecture to pixel-perfect interfaces, I care about every detail because people rely on what I build. I don‚Äôt just solve problems‚ÄîI create moments of connection and growth.

Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together.

Here are some technologies I enjoy working with:
